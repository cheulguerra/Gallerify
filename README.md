Content Images and Background Images
======================================

Downloading content images is not much of a challenge, but it is often tricky to find images which are part of the page design. The wallpaper, the elusive icon, even sometimes logos and buttons can be hard to get.

Gallerify can easily find and download all of them. 


Dynamic Images
================

Web pages often dynamically load and change content: news, tweets, posts. Gallerify is constantly looking for changes on the webpage and captures the new images, so you don't have to reload the app. In addition, if you have a search filter in action it applies it automatically. 

Live Search and Filters
==========================

Often the sheer number of images is too much to browse through. To help with that Gallerify has Quick Search. With Quick Search you can filter by:

    * Image type: icon, wallpaper, pixel
    * File type: JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.
    * Word or phrase contained in the image URL
    * Image size: just specify the width and height

And Yes, you can combine some commands to build complex size filters. For example show images that are "bigger than 10 x 10 and less than 100 x 100".
